**Team Members**: anna10, jydayan2, mgujral2, qingwen6

**Project Manager**: anchald2, tmenon3

**Project Description: 

**What problem is your project trying to solve? :

With vaccine distribution happening, it can be difficult to stay informed in a similar manner to the number of COVID-19 cases. There are many different sources providing information on when someone can receive the vaccine, how spread apart the doses are, locations where patients can receive the vaccine, and more general statistics such as the number of vaccines given in a local city or the number of days left until herd immunity. We are trying to solve these issues by providing all of this information about covid and vaccinations to the general public in a simple web app.

**Describe your MVP (Minimum Viable Product) : 

The minimum viable product is a web app with a functioning backend that provides users with a one-stop shop for everything vaccine-related. It will consist of both personal and general information regarding vaccine distribution, such as a personal status page with the vaccine, a dashboard with vaccine distribution statistics, local vaccine centers and resources, etc. Overall, the app will be similar to the safer Illinois app, but for vaccine distribution.

**What features make up your MVP? :

Number of vaccines given in local city
Tracker till next dose (color coded status card)
Days till herd immunity
Local vaccine distribution centers
