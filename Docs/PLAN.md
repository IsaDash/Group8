# PLAN

## Sprint 0
Brainstorming

## Sprint 1
Tutorials:

React tutorials: follow docs online for setting up npm, react
Assign task to frontend people to create a simple webpage with a basic header, buttons, and 1 navigation to a new page

Flask or Django tutorials: follow online docs for setting up a backend in python
Assign task to backend people to create a simple flask app that uses GET and POST requests

ML tutorials: research different predictive ML models that can be used with numerical time series data. Choose one and build a basic model on a sample dataset.

Research existing datasets/databases/apps/APIs relating to covid vaccinations.

## Sprint 2
Design what the frontend will look like on Figma.
Finish up tutorials.

Start building first feature of app and have backend and frontend teams collaborate
Feature to focus on: Live count of vaccines given in local city displayed on app

ML: finalize dataset to use for herd immunity feature, start experimenting with different models to find highest accuracy

## Sprint 3
Finish up first feature of app
Start building second feature of app:
Tracker till next dose status card
Frontend team should implement design of status card, log for when user took vaccine
Backend team should store user input and output the status and next vaccination day
ML: cleaning data and continue experimentation with models

## Sprint 4

Finish second feature of app
Start building third and fourth features:
Days until herd immunity
Frontend team should figure out how to display day counter or graph model
Backend team should implement ML to design model and use cleaned data
Local vaccine distribution centers
Frontend team should implement Google Maps API (or however they choose to display the locations)
Backend team should work on finding centers based on user location

## Sprint 5

Finish third and fourth features.

Try to implement features not listed in MVP, time-permitting (web scraper for updated info, more precise model for herd immunity, implementing real patient data

Combine frontend and backend work to get a nice flow through the website features and have it functional for users
